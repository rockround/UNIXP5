Homework 5 text

Bonus problems done:

Bonus 0 was done, -t parameter is selectable.

Bonus 3:

I would verify that my code is obtaining the correct results by testing the algorithm many times with sample sizes > 30 such that I can use the central limit theorem, and then use a z-test to determine the significance of any differences observed in results from the expected values. 

I would test the likelihood using 50% as the probability parameter, and use 400 samples. I will then see what my sample expected value is (the resulting distribution of successes and failures). 

I would then calculate the standard error, using sqrt(npq) as my standard deviation, and calculate the z-score of my results. I will then calculate the probability of getting this result after doing many tests, and determine if the p-value is significant enough to reject the null hypothesis of a random source. 


For the grader:

The seed generation used is based on child process PID to ensure that rapid execution is not a problem (time based seeding) and that in general all seeds are unique (since all PIDs are unique).
